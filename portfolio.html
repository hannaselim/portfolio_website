            <br>
        <p>In Basic Web we learned about different layout principles. I chose to use Gestalt's law of Symmetry when creating my first website, in particular the two column layout in the body. I chose this law instead of the other principles because it  was functional and not difficult to code as my abilities were limited at the time.

                <br>
                <p>02.01.03 Link to Video: The next assignment was to create a video without words which consisted groups of three. We decided to be abstract, without the conventionalist approach to create more suspense.</p>

                <br>
                <p>02.01.05 Treatment: This was the driving force of our groupwork as we developed a plot based on the principles of story telling; to have a beginning, ending, protagonist, antagonist and conflict to be resolved. We implemented the model of dramatical progression, we learned "a point of no return".</p>
                <button onclick="window.location.href='http://hannaselim.dk/storyboard.pdf'" class="button">02.01.07 Storyboard</button>
                <p>02.01.07 Storyboard: We couldn't create a story without visualisation, therefore we made a representation of our production. We included the frames, duration and movement. We thought about the use of space and lighting and what audio and sound effects can be utilised to create more dynamic.</p>

                <p>02.01.08 Documentation: To track and show evidence of our progress we documented everything we completed from scratch to the final production. </p>

                <p>02.01.09 Links to micro site: Here is the final production with our website and video. This was my favourite theme during MMD. My passion for video production and storytelling was challenged and has definitely taught me many valuable skills such as producing basic-level digital content based on user understanding and based on a given

                <br>
                <p>This is the simple animation task we did, it allowed us to explore the javascript functions. There were some challenges but as the theme progressed we began to learn from our mistakes and improved.</p>
                <button onclick="window.location.href='http://hannaselim.dk/week_submission_03.02.01.pdf'" class="button">03.02.01 Week submission</button>
                <p>03.02.01 Week submission: This task challenged our abilities to create an animation that can follow a story. Thus, each individual had the creative freedom of developing a short story including a protagonist and antagonist while targeting dramaturgical elements. I created my characters using Adobe Illustrator CC 2018</p>

                <p>03.03.02 Interactive animation: this task was similar to the week submission, however this time we could work in pairs to use inspiration from existing fairytales and short stories to create a dynamic animation.</p>

                <p>03.03.03 Project Pool One - For this project pool we were in groups. Our task was to create an advanced type of animation in the name of a game or special feature. The focus was mainly on adding EventListeners. For day one, we created the fly game.</p>
                <button onclick="window.location.href='http://hannaselim.dk/project_pool_one/fly/'" class="button">03.03.03 Project Pool Two</button>
                <p>03.03.03 Project Pool two: The second project pool was the drum kit sonata. This had more advanced features. Since we were in a group, guidance was not urgent as we had the ability to bounce ideas off one another.</p>
