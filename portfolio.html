            <br>
        <p>In Basic Web we learned about different layout principles. I chose to use Gestalt's law of Symmetry when creating my first website, in particular the two column layout in the body. I chose this law instead of the other principles because it  was functional and not difficult to code as my abilities were limited at the time.

                <p>02.01.03 Link to Video: The next assignment was to create a video without words which consisted groups of three. We decided to be abstract, without the conventionalist approach to create more suspense.</p>

                <br>
                <p>02.01.05 Treatment: This was the driving force of our groupwork as we developed a plot based on the principles of story telling; to have a beginning, ending, protagonist, antagonist and conflict to be resolved. We implemented the model of dramatical progression, we learned "a point of no return".</p>

                <p>02.01.07 Storyboard: We couldn't create a story without visualisation, therefore we made a representation of our production. We included the frames, duration and movement. We thought about the use of space and lighting and what audio and sound effects can be utilised to create more dynamic.</p>

                <p>02.01.09 Links to micro site: Here is the final production with our website and video. This was my favourite theme during MMD. My passion for video production and storytelling was challenged and has definitely taught me many valuable skills such as producing basic-level digital content based on user understanding and based on a given

                <br>
                <p>This is the simple animation task we did, it allowed us to explore the javascript functions. There were some challenges but as the theme progressed we began to learn from our mistakes and improved.</p>
                <button onclick="window.location.href='http://hannaselim.dk/week_submission_03.02.01.pdf'" class="button">03.02.01 Week submission</button>
                <p>03.02.01 Week submission: This task challenged our abilities to create an animation that can follow a story. Thus, each individual had the creative freedom of developing a short story including a protagonist and antagonist while targeting dramaturgical elements. I created my characters using Adobe Illustrator CC 2018</p>

                <p>03.03.02 Interactive animation: this task was similar to the week submission, however this time we could work in pairs to use inspiration from existing fairytales and short stories to create a dynamic animation.</p>

                <p>03.03.03 Project Pool One - For this project pool we were in groups. Our task was to create an advanced type of animation in the name of a game or special feature. The focus was mainly on adding EventListeners. For day one, we created the fly game.</p>
                <button onclick="window.location.href='http://hannaselim.dk/project_pool_two/drums/drum.html'" class="button">03.03.03 Project Pool Two</button>
                <p>03.03.03 Project Pool two: The second project pool was the drum kit sonata. This had more advanced features. Since we were in a group, guidance was not urgent as we had the ability to bounce ideas off one another.</p>

                <p>03.04.05 Final interactive production: This was the last interactive animation project we created as a group. We based our animation on the "Titanic" and learned about "Easter Eggs". There were six people in each  group. Each pair in the group were given the role of coders, designers and UX designers. I and Ewa carried out the UX responsibilities. This was the project where I greatly improved my animation skills.

                <p>03.04.06 Link to screen cast documentation: this was the last step - the documentation process. We created a video to explain the steps we took to reach production completion. We carried out user tests and feedback to make improvements.

                <br>
                <p>Design Sprint was a five day process. We were presented with a client; Fredrikke - Head of Multimedia Design and Communication. The subject concerned improveing the current univeristy learning management portal "Fronter". Our task as UX designers was to identify the uses of, problems with and potential solutions for - Fronter. Therefore, I created my "ideal" fronter through using an XD Prototype.</p>
                <button onclick="window.location.href='http://hannaselim.dk/kea_portal/index.html'" class="button">04.03.01. Web prototype</button>
                <p>This task involved group work. All members discussed based on the client's opinion, strategies and steps necessary to create an effective learning management system. Our goal's primary focus was a multi-way communication system. This web prototype was a coded template of what our app would look like. It is a mobile only version.</p>

                <p>04.04.01. Native app: The main goal that we set while creating our solution was to make a learning management app that would provide great user experience to the students. Every student has different priorities, that is why we decided to focus on a cutomisable homescreen, to meet user expectations.</p>
